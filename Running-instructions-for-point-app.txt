Running the points program

Have provided the Readme.md files in all the three modules and shared the source code accordingly
	spring-boot-app(run as spring boot app)
	console-app (run as java jar)
	ui-app (run as angular app)
	
	to run these apps follow the below steps 

------------- Spring boot app 
prerequisites for running the app :
    create a database schema with name "point_app" in mysql(5.6) and run the below query to create a table
        CREATE TABLE `point` (
        	`id` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        	`created_by` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        	`created_on` DATETIME NOT NULL,
        	`last_updated_by` VARCHAR(255) NULL DEFAULT NULL,
        	`last_updated_on` DATETIME NULL DEFAULT NULL,
        	`measurement_location` VARCHAR(255) NULL DEFAULT NULL,
        	`measurement_day` BIGINT(20) NULL DEFAULT NULL,
        	`measurement_value` DOUBLE(20,2) NULL DEFAULT NULL,
        	PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
        	UNIQUE INDEX `location-day` (`measurement_location`, `measurement_day`)
        )
    have set the property "spring.jpa.generate-ddl=true" for creating table just in case.
  Requires java-8

Run the app as a spring boot application (on default port - 8080)

The api's exposed are
view points (http-get) -- http://localhost:8080/api/v1/points 
					or -- http://localhost:8080/api/v1/points?offset=20&limit=10
add point (http-post) -- http://localhost:8080/api/v1/points
    sample json : {"measurementDay": "2018-12-17", "location": "FI", "value": 15}
delete api (http-delete) -- http://localhost:8080/api/v1/points?id=0c157350-aabd-4c55-a42e-6e2de16b195b
    pass the id of the point to be deleted

This app also has the junit test cases written for all the above api's, service class and repository class.


----------------- Console app
Run the console app as a java jar application
command to run is -- (use java8)
    java -jar console-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar

this console app will create the points by hitting the add-point api form the main class
    this creates the point by randomly generating
        measurement-value(0-1000),
        measurement-day(in 2018) and
        measurement location(EE,FI,LV)

you can stop the process of creating the points by hitting "ctrl-c"


------------------ ui-app
This project was generated with [Angular CLI] version 7.1.4.

This project was generated using node version node -v -- v10.14.2

do a npm install then 

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. 
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

This app has one page which shows the summary and grid which shows all rows. 
You can delete the point by selecting the row and hit on delete button.
The filter icon is provided next Measurementlocation header where you can filter on location
